This is the distribution version of [topheman/d3-react-experiments](https://github.com/topheman/d3-react-experiments) - v2.3.0 - [#8153b2d](https://github.com/topheman/d3-react-experiments/tree/8153b2dc2186c64ccfa0004220bb83f865f2ffd4).

### Infos:

Those informations are available on the [topheman/webpack-babel-starter](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter) project:

* [How those files where generated (Readme - build section)](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter#build)
* [How to deploy your generated version (Wiki - deploy section)](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter/wiki#deploy)

As explained in the [README](https://github.com/topheman/webpack-babel-starter#build), when you `npm run build-prod-all`, two versions will be generated:

* One at the root (the production version)
* One in the [devtools folder](https://github.com/topheman/d3-react-experiments/tree/gh-pages/devtools), which contains as you'll see sourcemaps and are not minified.

Test the demo [here](https://topheman.github.io/d3-react-experiments/).
